[INSTRUCTION]
I have filled out `my_details.txt` with my personal information. Please perform the following automated setup sequence. Do not stop for confirmation between steps.

STEP 0: CRITICAL SYSTEM CHECK
- FIRST, check if Node.js is installed by running `node -v` in the terminal.
- IF NODE IS MISSING (Command not found):
  - Try to install it automatically:
    - Windows: `winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS`
    - Mac: `brew install node`
  - IF INSTALL SUCCESSFUL: STOP everything. Tell me: "✅ Node.js installed! Please RESTART your VS Code window now, then run this prompt again."
  - IF INSTALL FAILS: STOP everything. Tell me: "❌ Node.js is missing. Please install it from https://nodejs.org/ and restart VS Code."
- IF NODE IS INSTALLED: Proceed to Step 1 immediately.

STEP 1: UPDATE CONTENT
- Read `my_details.txt` carefully.
- Update `src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx` with my Name, Tagline, and Bio.
- Update `src/components/sections/AboutSection.tsx` with my Education and Skills.
- Update `src/components/sections/ProjectsSection.tsx` with my Projects.
- Update `src/components/sections/ExperienceSection.tsx` with my Internships.
- Update `src/components/sections/CertificationsSection.tsx` with my Certifications.
- Update `src/components/sections/ContactSection.tsx` and `Navbar.tsx` with my Links/Initials.

STEP 2: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
- Run `npm install` to download all necessary packages.

STEP 3: SETUP GIT
- Run `git init` to initialize the repository.
- Run `git add .` to stage all files.
- Run `git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup"` to save the first version.

STEP 4: VERIFY BUILD
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the website has no errors.

STEP 5: COMPLETION
- If the build succeeds, tell me: "Setup Complete! Run 'npm run dev' to see your website."
